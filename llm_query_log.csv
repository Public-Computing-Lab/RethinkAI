Based on this dataset alone, the neighborhood with the fewest recorded incidents would appear to be the safest. However, this is not a complete picture of safety. Factors like population size (which isn't in this dataset) greatly influence incident rates. A neighborhood with a very small population might have few incidents simply due to the small number of residents, not necessarily because it's inherently safer than a larger neighborhood with more reported incidents.  Further data would be needed for a more robust analysis of safety.  Looking only at raw incident counts can be misleading.
