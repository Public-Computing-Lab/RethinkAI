# RethinkAI - Experiment 3

## Plotly Dash & LLM Chat interface

This experiment uses the Plotly Dash framework to present a public safety dashboard using data from the BPD Data Hub [https://boston-pd-crime-hub-boston.hub.arcgis.com/pages/data].

The interface includes an LLM chat window for interacting with transcripts from community meeting in the Dorchester Neighborhood where residents discussed public safety.
